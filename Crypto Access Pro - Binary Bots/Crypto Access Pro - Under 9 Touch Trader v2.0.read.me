# Crypto Access Pro - Under 9 Touch Trader v2.0 - Automated Trading Bot

This `README.md` provides a comprehensive overview and evaluation of the Crypto Access Pro - Under 9 Touch Trader v2.0 trading bot, developed in Cursor.ai.

## 1. Trading Goals and Strategy

* **Objectives:** Short-term profit generation through digit under trading on synthetic indices, with a focus on "touch" events and martingale money management.
* **Risk Tolerance:** Medium to High. Uses a martingale factor for stake adjustment after losses, which can accelerate recovery but increases risk during losing streaks.
* **Assets Traded:** Synthetic indices (e.g., 1HZ10V) on binary options platforms.
* **Strategy Type:** Digit Under 9 Touch with Martingale. The bot places trades predicting the last digit will be under 9, using a martingale system to increase stake after losses and reset after wins. It tracks digit "touch" events for trade logic.
