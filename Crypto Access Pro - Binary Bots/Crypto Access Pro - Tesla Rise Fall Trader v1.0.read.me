# Crypto Access Pro - Tesla Rise Fall Trader v1.0 - Automated Trading Bot

This `README.md` provides a comprehensive overview and evaluation of the Crypto Access Pro - Tesla Rise Fall Trader v1.0 trading bot, developed in Cursor.ai.

## 1. Trading Goals and Strategy

* **Objectives:** Short-term profit generation through rise/fall (call/put) trading on synthetic indices using RSI and martingale money management.
