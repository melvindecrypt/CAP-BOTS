## 1. Trading Goals and Strategy

The bot identifies a "box" or trading range during a specific time window (16:05-16:20), then waits for price to break above or below this range with confirmation from a 4-hour EMA filter. It places trades only once per day to avoid overtrading.

Trades are only placed if price is also above/below the 4-hour EMA. Stop losses are set at the opposite end of the box, and trailing stops are applied.
